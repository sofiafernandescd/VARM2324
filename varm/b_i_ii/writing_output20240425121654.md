The provided Python script performs face recognition tasks by loading face images from a directory, resizing them to the MPEG-7 format, detecting eyes using Haar Cascade classifier, and normalizing the faces (though the current implementation lacks code for rotation and scaling). This process is crucial for ensuring consistent face representation in various applications.

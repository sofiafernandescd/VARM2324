In the current task, we are provided with a code snippet that generates a normalized face database by loading and processing a set of face images. The main reasoning behind this code lies in the need for standardized face images to ensure effective face recognition. By normalizing the face images, we ensure consistency in their representation regardless of variations in pose, scale, or orientation. This normalized face database can be used for various tasks such as training machine learning models for face recognition or performing face recognition in real-time applications.

This Python script loads a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier model from an XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) to detect faces in an input image. The `detect_faces` function takes an image as input, converts it to grayscale using the `cvtColor` function, and then uses the cascade classifier to detect faces by analyzing small rectangular regions of the image for specific features. The detected faces are represented as rectangles, which are drawn on the output image using the `rectangle` function. Finally, the script loads an image, detects faces in it, and displays the output using the `imshow` function.

The script uses the following libraries:
1. OpenCV (cv2) - A popular open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of functions for image processing and computer vision tasks. It is used to load the cascade classifier, convert images to grayscale, detect faces, and display the output.
2. Numpy - A powerful numerical computing library in Python that allows efficient handling of large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It is used to handle the input image and perform operations on it.

The script can be improved by adding error handling mechanisms, optimizing the code for better performance, and incorporating additional features such as saving the output image or detecting multiple faces in an image. Overall, this Python script provides a solid foundation for implementing face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier with OpenCV and Numpy libraries.

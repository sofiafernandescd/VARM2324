The provided Python script utilizes OpenCV library for implementing face detection through Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm. The Haar Cascade Classifier is an integral part of the OpenCV library, which is based on the Viola-Jones object detection framework proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their 2001 paper titled "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features."

The script begins by importing the required OpenCV library. Next, it loads the Haar cascade classifier for face detection from the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file using the `CascadeClassifier()` method. This pre-trained classifier is specifically designed to detect frontal faces.

The `detect_faces()` function takes an input image as its argument and performs the following tasks:
1. Converts the input image from BGR color space to grayscale using the `cv2.cvtColor()` method.
2. Detects faces in the grayscale image by calling the `CascadeClassifier.detectMultiScale()` method on the loaded classifier object, passing the grayscale image as an argument. This method returns a list of rectangles representing detected faces along with their locations and sizes.
3. Draws rectangles around each detected face using the `cv2.rectangle()` function.
4. Displays the output image with detected faces using OpenCV's `imshow()` function.

The main reasoning behind this code lies in the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm, which is a machine learning-based approach for object detection. It works by training a classifier to recognize specific features (Haar features) that are indicative of an object (in our case, a face). The pre-trained 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file contains these learned Haar features and is used to detect faces in new images.

The script reads the input image using OpenCV's `imread()` function, processes it through the `detect_faces()` function, and displays the output with detected faces using OpenCV's `imshow()` function. The window displaying the output is kept open until a key event occurs, which is handled by OpenCV's `waitKey()` and `destroyAllWindows()` functions.

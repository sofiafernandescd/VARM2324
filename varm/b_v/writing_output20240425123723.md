In this Python script, we perform face recognition using OpenCV and NumPy. We begin by loading a face database consisting of grayscale images. Next, we extract features from these faces using EigenFaces, which involves computing the mean face vector and transformation matrix containing the first 'm' eigenvectors. These eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis for the subspace spanned by them. We then project each training set face onto this subspace and calculate the error between the original face and its reconstruction in this subspace. These error faces are orthogonal to the subspace. Finally, we use a Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classifier based on these feature vectors for classification.

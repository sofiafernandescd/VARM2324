The provided Python script demonstrates the usage of OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (dnn) module for face detection. This is achieved by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models based on the ResNet architecture and Single Shot Detector (SSD).

The code begins by importing necessary libraries, including OpenCV's CascadeClassifier for traditional face detection and dnn module for deep learning-based face detection. The pre-trained model files are loaded from their respective locations within the OpenCV library.

A VideoCapture object is created to capture video from the webcam. A while loop is then used to continuously read frames from the camera feed, convert them into a blob format suitable for inputting into the neural network, and pass it through the network for processing. The detections made by the network are stored in the 'detections' variable.

The script also uses OpenCV's CascadeClassifier to detect faces in the image using the Haar Cascade algorithm. This algorithm is a popular method for object detection, particularly for face and facial feature detection. The scaleFactor and minNeighbors parameters are used to fine-tune the detection process.

Once the faces have been detected, they are drawn as rectangles on the original image using the cv2.rectangle() function. Finally, the resulting image is displayed in a window using cv2.imshow(). The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed, at which point the camera feed is released and all windows are closed.

In summary, this Python script effectively utilizes OpenCV's dnn module for real-time face detection by leveraging powerful pre-trained CNN models based on the ResNet architecture and SSD. The combination of traditional and deep learning-based methods allows for efficient and accurate detection of faces in video feeds.

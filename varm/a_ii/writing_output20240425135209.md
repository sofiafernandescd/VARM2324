OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (dnn) module is used for face detection due to its inclusion of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models based on the ResNet architecture and Single Shot Detector (SSD). The ResNet architecture provides improved training and reduced degradation, while the SSD allows for real-time multi-scale and multi-aspect ratio detection of faces. Together, these features make OpenCV's dnn module a powerful tool for face detection applications.

The code presented in this task utilizes OpenCV and NumPy libraries for face recognition using EigenFaces as a method for dimensionality reduction. The main goal is to learn the underlying structure of faces in an image database, which will be used later for recognizing new faces. Let's dive deeper into the reasoning behind each step of this code.

First, we import the necessary libraries: OpenCV and NumPy. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides various algorithms for image processing, feature extraction, object detection, and more. NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python.

Next, we load the face database by iterating through each image in the training_set folder and reading them as grayscale images using OpenCV's imread function. Each face is represented as a monochrome image with 56 rows and 46 columns.

Now comes the crucial part: computing the mean face vector and eigenfaces using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that seeks to find a new coordinate system in which the variance of the data is maximized. In this case, we use it to find the average face (mean face) and the directions of maximum variance (eigenfaces) within our training set. The mean face vector is computed by taking the mean value of all pixels across all faces in the database. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are then calculated using NumPy's eig function, which returns both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues as separate arrays. We only keep the first m eigenvectors (where m can be a number between 10 and 20) to maintain a reasonable dimensionality for our face subspace.

Once we have the mean face vector and eigenfaces, we project each training set face onto this subspace by taking the dot product of the image and the eigenfaces matrix. The reconstruction is then obtained by adding the mean face vector to the projection. We display both the original and reconstructed faces for visual comparison.

Finally, we compute the error face (difference between the original and reconstructed face) for each training set image and display them as well. To prove that these error faces are orthogonal to the face subspace, we calculate the dot product of each error face with every eigenface in our subspace. If the result is zero for all eigenfaces, then the error face is indeed orthogonal to the face subspace.

In summary, this code performs face recognition using EigenFaces as a dimensionality reduction technique. It computes the mean face vector and eigenfaces from the training set, projects each face onto the face subspace, reconstructs faces, displays original and reconstructed faces, and proves that error faces are orthogonal to the face subspace.

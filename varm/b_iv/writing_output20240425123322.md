The given Python script is focused on implementing two popular methods for face recognition: EigenFaces and FisherFaces. Both methods aim to represent faces as low-dimensional vectors in a subspace, allowing efficient storage and comparison of facial data. Let's delve deeper into the reasoning behind each method.

1. EigenFaces:
The first part of the script computes the mean face vector and transformation matrix using the EigenFaces algorithm. This method is based on finding a set of orthogonal basis vectors (eigenfaces) that best represent the variations in the training set faces. The mean face vector represents the average face in the dataset, while the transformation matrix contains the eigenfaces as its columns. By projecting each face onto this subspace and reconstructing it using the first m eigenfaces, we can obtain a low-dimensional representation of the original face.

The script then projects some training set faces onto the face subspace and displays their reconstructions. The error between the original and reconstructed faces is also computed and displayed to assess the accuracy of the method.

2. FisherFaces:
The second part of the script computes the mean face vector and transformation matrix using the FisherFaces algorithm. This method is based on finding a set of basis vectors that maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter in the training set data. The mean face vector represents the average face for each class, while the transformation matrix contains the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. By projecting each face onto this subspace and reconstructing it using the first m eigenvectors, we can obtain a low-dimensional representation of the original face that is optimized for separating different classes.

The script then projects some training set faces onto the face subspace using FisherFaces and displays their reconstructions. The error between the original and reconstructed faces is also computed and displayed to assess the accuracy of the method.

In summary, both EigenFaces and FisherFaces methods aim to represent faces as low-dimensional vectors in a subspace for efficient storage and comparison. However, they differ in their approach to finding the basis vectors: EigenFaces finds orthogonal basis vectors that best represent the variations in the data, while FisherFaces finds basis vectors that maximize the separation between classes. The given script implements both methods and compares their performance by displaying the original faces, their reconstructions, and the errors between them.
